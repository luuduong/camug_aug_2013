#Getting Started

##Send me your github username (create an account if you don't have one) - <mailto:jp@developwithpassion.com>

##Requirements

* Recommend the use of a ruby version manager (such as [RVM](https://rvm.io/))
* Fork this repository (using the github account your provided me by email)
* Clone your fork of this repository (I recommend cloning it to a path without spaces)
* Navigate to the cloned repo folder in your shell
* Run the following commands:

  ```bash
   . ./cenv
   ./run_first
   ./start_new_exercise
  ```

* Verify that everything is working by running the tests:

  ```bash
   bundle exec ruby proofs/suite.rb 
  ```
  - You should see output similar to the following:

    ```bash
